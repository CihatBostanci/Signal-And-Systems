# Signal-And-Systems
The Discrete Signal Normalization and Convolution

Importing these libraries is necessary


import numpy as np
import sys
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

In the beginning, Discrete signals that have high dimensions and needed the resolution and 
is the best practice to learn how to analyze understanding fundementals about Signal and Systems. 
In this code is about the evaluation of the discrete signals.
